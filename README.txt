*Where is everything located?

Dimensionality reduction techniques are implemented in different files. The main file to run is "solution.ipynb". 
We import the libraries and other files we have coded, write helper methods; prepare, apply scaling and dimensionality 
reduction to the data in this Jupyter noteboook.

"csv_operation.py" includes methods to read and write to csv files and create a submission file.

"factor_analysis.py", "pca.py" and  "functionLDA.py" contains dimensionality reduction implementations.

INSTRUCTIONS - How to run the code
1. Open this folder which includes "solution.ipynb", in an editor that can run Jupyter notebook by cells.
2. Make sure that "data" folder that includes the training and test datasets exist.
3. Open "solution.ipynb". Run cells one by one until section "Factor Analysis"
4. There are 3 sections that includes all 3 reduction techniques. Choose one. Change output name if needed.
5. Run the cells in that section. An output file will be created with the submission format.
